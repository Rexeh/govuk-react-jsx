# govuk-react-jsx

View demo at https://andymantell.github.io/govuk-react-jsx/

- Documentation
- Additional things like the base template?
- Additional examples from local yaml files
- Additional tests around interacting with components (Can we pull in from govuk-frontend somehow?)
- Demos of buttons with click events, input elements with change events etc
- Some kind of management around git tags and package versions?
- Remove ignoreAttributes: ['style'] from nunjucks diffing code
- Look for guarded access to deep object properties and replace with optional chaining
- Document that selected property of select items no longer exists (Since it's just value on the select element in React) (And add test for it)
- Why does hot reloading sometimes break the data processing, such that html comes out as [object Object]?
- lack of onChange handler is causing select element to throw warning because it is read only
- Align eslint / prettier config etc with main repo
- Test case for Radios top level value prop - being mapped correctly to checked status of items
